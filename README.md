# PrinPy

PrinPy is an implementation of principal curves in Python, based rougly on [this](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/Principal_Curves.pdf) paper. 

## Future:
1. Currently, only simple curves are supported. For example, x must be strictly increasing. I would like to change this eventually.
2. Move to C++. Right now it is completely written in Python with a lot of support from sciPy. I hope to use C++ to speed up calculations.
